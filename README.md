# InnoSetup Dialog

I will be trying to create a dialog that asks for an input from the user in this branch

# assets

This folder will contain image files that will be used within the installer

# bin

This folder will contain the exe file that is generated

# src

This folder will contain the files that would be put together with the installer

# About the uses

You can freely use all the branches that are on this repo for your own purposes as well. I would really appreciate it if you would leave out a small "thank you" note in your installer if you did happen to use my code.

Thank you and happy coding!
